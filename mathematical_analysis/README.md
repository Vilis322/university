## ***DESCRIPTION FOR cauchy_problem.py***
+ This script implements the Modified Euler method (Heun's method) to numerically solve ordinary differential equations.

## ***The script consists of the following steps:***
1. #### *Initialization*
   + defines an example function (in this case, a simple addition) to represent the differential equation;
   + initializes the starting values for \x_0 and y_0, the step size h, and the number of iterations n.
2. #### *Modified Euler Method*
