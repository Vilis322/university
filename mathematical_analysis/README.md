## ***DESCRIPTION FOR cauchy_problem.py***
+ This script implements the Modified Euler method (Heun's method) to numerically solve ordinary differential equations.

## ***The script consists of the following steps:***
1. #### *Initialization*
   + defines an example function (in this case, a simple addition) to represent the differential equation;
   + initializes the starting values for x0 and y0, the step size h, and the number of iterations n.
2. #### *Modified Euler Method*
    + iterates n times to compute the next values of x and y;
    + for each step, it calculates an intermediate y1_next value using the standard Euler method;
    + then, it computes the final y_next value by averaging the slopes at the current and next points;
    + the new values of x and y are stored in their respective lists.
3. #### *Result*
   + the script prints the computed x-values and y-values after completing all iterations of the method.

4. #### *Integral Approximation*
   + the script applies Simpson's method by summing the function values at the even and odd indexed points, with different weights for each set;
   + the first and last function values are weighted by 1, even-indexed function values are weighted by 4, and odd-indexed function values are weighted by 2.
