## ***DESCRIPTION FOR continued_fraction_converter.py***
+ #### This script converts a rational number into its continued fraction representation using the Euclidean algorithm.

## ***The script consists of the following steps:***
1. #### *Quotient Calculation*
    + perform integer division of the numerator by the denominator to obtain the quotient.
2. #### *Iteration*
    + update the numerator and denominator using the remainder and repeat until the denominator becomes zero.
3. #### *Result*
    + the sequence of quotients forms the continued fraction representation of the given rational number.

## ***REQUIREMENTS***
+ **Python 3.x**

## ***DESCRIPTION FOR fermat_prime_check.py***
+ #### This script implements a primality test based on Fermat's factorization method.

## ***The script consists of the following steps:***
1. #### *Validation*
    + if the number is less than 2, it is not prime.
2. #### *Base cases*
    + if the number is 2, it is prime;
    + if the number is even and greater than 2, it is not prime.
3. #### *Fermat's Factorization*
    + check whether the number can be expressed at the difference of two squares.
4. #### *Composite Check*
    + if such a decomposition exists, the number is composite.
    + if no decomposition is found, the number is prime.

## ***REQUIREMENTS***
+ **Python 3.0x**

## ***DESCRIPTION FOR gcd_lcm_calculator.py***
+ #### This script calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.

## ***The script consists of the following steps:***
1. #### *GCD Calculation*
    + uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
2. #### *LCM Calculation*
    + calculates the least common multiple using the formula.
3. #### *Result*
    + prints the GCD and LCM of two given numbers.

## ***REQUIREMENTS***
+ *Python 3.x*

---

## ***DESCRIPTION FOR logical_NOR.py***
+ #### This script generates a truth table for the logical operation "NOR" (NOT OR) for two boolean inputs A and B.

## ***REQUIREMENTS***
+ *Python 3.x*
