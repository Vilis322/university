### The task includes three parts:
+ plotting spectral luminosity versus frequency f for different temperatures using Planck's formula;
+ finding the frequency fmax, at which the maximum luminosity is reached, and verifying Wien's displacement law;
+ verification of the Stefan-Boltzmann law: dependence of total energy on temperature.
