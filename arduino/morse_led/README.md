# Morse LED – Arduino/Tinkercad

This Arduino project blinks an LED on pin 13 using Morse code to transmit "SOS" (`... --- ...`).

## Circuit
- LED connected to pin **13**
- Resistor ~220Ω in series

## How to use
1. Open `morse_led.ino` in Arduino IDE.  
2. Upload to your Arduino board.  
3. The LED will blink the SOS signal.
